      <p class="grey">Dr. Natacha Villamia Sochat was born in New York City. She grew up in La Habana, Cuba and in New York City where she attended the Bronx HS of Science. She worked as a professional photographer in Berlin, Germany including freelance work for &quot;Berlin Today&quot; magazine. She is a Summa Cum Laude graduate of Boston University (B.A. Biology, minor art history) and received her M.D. degree from Boston University School of Medicine. Her post-baccalaureate studies at Brandeis University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and School of the Museum of Fine Arts Boston included painting, printmaking, photography, and video. She received her MFA in Studio Arts from Tufts University/School of the Museum Fine Arts, Boston.<br />

        <br />
