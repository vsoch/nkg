      <p>Two  abiding interests have shaped Prilla Smith Brackett's recent artwork, a  fascination for the strength and mystery of forests and trees, and an  appreciation of the role of place in forming and sustaining the thread of  memory.</p>
      <p>She was  first awed by forest landscape in the Colombian jungle, along the Amazon, when  she was visiting the family of her family's Colombian exchange student. The  enormous buttresses of the towering trees and the tangled lianae captured her  imagination. While at the Bunting Institute at Radcliffe Brackett made mural  sized black and white drawings. Later she was able to continue using rainforest  images because of opportunities to draw and photograph in both Malagasy and  Costa Rican jungles. Having grown up with parents who believed that we are on  this earth to make it better, she wanted to draw attention to the plight of  jungles, so the work began to have an environmental emphasis. Ultimately,  needing to find forests closer to home, she took on a project in which she did  a drawing a day for a year of natural outdoor subjects, and also began focusing  on nordic northern forests. She found and hiked to pockets of old growth forest  in northern New England to photograph. Drawings and paintings done in the  studio became an exhibition which traveled to 8 locations. ”Remnants: Ancient  Forests &amp; City Trees.” she juxtaposed and fragmented urban and forest  trees, suggesting the struggle between constraint and freedom, the conflict of  the natural and man-made worlds.</p>
      <p>Reflecting  on this work, Brackett realized that perhaps her interests in trees came in  part from childhood memories. Trees were an essential part of her relationship  with her father. When her siblings were young, he bought wooded land with a  stream and meadows outside West Hartford, CT. They camped out there, having  adventures in the stream, learning about pit toilets, and helping make a  lean-to on the top of the “mountain” with small trees he had felled. When he  started planting tiny evergreens to start a tree farm, She remembers the  pleasure of planting with him. He loved nurturing his trees and taking care of  the land. Friends came at Christmas time to choose and cut trees, and haul them  by toboggan up to their cars on the paved road, while a roaring fire and hot  cider in the tiny farmhouse gave recent arrivals courage for the hunt.</p>
      <p>Trees  and family memories figure together in another body of recent prints and  paintings. Brackett's maternal grandparents bought a rambling summer cottage on  Duxbury Bay in 1915 , when her mother was a toddler. After housing many  multi-generational gatherings, it became clear on her mother's death that  Brackett's family could not afford keep it. She decided to discover, through  artwork, what was important to her about the place. Of most interest was the  sleeping porch, a second-story structure lined with windows looking out on  trees and the bay. Seen from inside, outside, or from the breezy porch  underneath it offered many opportunities for artistic exploration. The old  hospital beds, put there by her grandmother for her children and used by  Brackett's, were still there. She liked the way the angles of the windows,  furniture, and exposed structure took one out into the landscape. Downstairs,  views of the porch from inside often included a chair or a portion of a  hammock. She liked how such glimpses of furniture suggested the recent presence  of someone, someone who had just left, or someone from the distant past. The  trees surrounding the porch seemed also to stand for family or friends from the  past. And crazy as it might sound, she sometimes thought of the house and its  immediate trees and surroundings as being one organism, a vital communion of  the manmade and the natural projecting a feeling of loss, the incompleteness of  memory, and the transience of time. Anxious that she might lose this rich  source of image and emotion, she thoroughly photographed the house and its  furniture, including the bed in which her mother was born, just before the  family packed up the place in 2005.</p>
      <p>Several years ago, when Brackett realized that she wanted  to return to forest images, she thought of the old house on the bay and the  furniture from earlier generations that had been such a part of her family's  life. She wanted to put her two compelling interests together by placing  transparent images of that furniture into a forest setting, juxtaposing the  memory-charged domestic with the awe-inspiring natural. This body of work thus  represents a kind of synthesis of many years of art-making, one that has much  yet to offer..</p>
